Join x8x channel at freenode to talk about the emulator.

Compiling and running
=====================

So far, this emulator works only on Unix systems. It was tested on Ubuntu and Arch Linux.

To compile IBM5150 you will need to install g++, yasm and SDL. After you've done that run:

cd IBM5150; make; ./ibm5150 mda.cfg > log.txt

You should see a black window on the screen and log.txt should contain everything the emulator has been doing.

You can get character ROM from http://www.minuszerodegrees.net/rom/IBM_5788005_AM9264_1981_CGA_MDA_CARD.BIN and BIOS from http://www.minuszerodegrees.net/bios/bios.htm.

I don't quite understand how transfers are started.

MDA

Only updates every frame. Might want to change that eventually.

CGA

It's got basic text and graphics capabilities.

8088
----

Only accurate on an opcode-level.

80286

VERY rudimentary.

PIT
---

Not complete, but the basics are there.

PPI

Much to be done here.

PIC

It's sorta there, but still incomplete.
